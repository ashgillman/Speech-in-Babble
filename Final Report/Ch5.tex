\section{Humanly Perceived Improvement vs. Machine Performance}

The aim of conducting research into existing data was to determine,
at a basic level, the correlation between \ac{HR} and \ac{MR}.


\subsection{Investigating Existing Data}

Results from conducting a direct comparison between \ac{PESQ} and
\ac{PRR} results were given in \figref{Direct-PESQ-PRR}. These results
show a general, positive correlation between \ac{PESQ} and \ac{PRR};
and, by extension, between \ac{HR} and \ac{MR}. The level of correlation
appears to be relatively low, however comparison with \figref{litResCorr}
indicates the such levels of correlation are expected. Indeed, similar
correlations are observed between \ac{PESQ} and \ac{MOS} results,
which are both \ac{HR} measures.

A number of further observations were drawn from \figref{Direct-PESQ-PRR},
and are highlighted in \Cref{fig:direct-klt-mband,fig:direct-klt-pklt,fig:direct-pklt-logmmse-spu-4,fig:direct-highcorr}.

Despite the acceptable correlation between \ac{PESQ} and \ac{PRR}
observed, there is still evidence to show that algorithms' performances
vary depending on the performance measure used. For example, highlighted
in \figref{direct-klt-mband} are two algorithms, the \ac{KLT} method
and the \ac{MBAND} method, that exhibited similar performances when
evaluated by \ac{PRR}, a machine measure. However, when evaluated
by a human perceptual method, \ac{PESQ}, the \ac{KLT} method clearly
performed better. In fact, the \ac{KLT} method exhibited one of the
best performances seen on the \ac{PESQ} scale, whereas the \ac{MBAND}
method was the worst performer on this scale, exhibiting loss in perceptual
quality, as indicated by the negative performance.

\end{figure}


\figref{direct-klt-pklt} shows the \ac{PESQ} vs. \ac{PRR} improvement
with the \ac{KLT} and \ac{pKLT} algorithm performances highlighted.
This was noted as an example of two very similar algorithms, with
varying performance between \ac{HR} and \ac{MR} results. The \ac{KLT}
results exhibited better performance for a human listener, as the
points laid higher on the y-axis, whereas the \ac{pKLT} results exhibited
better performance for a machine recogniser, as the points laid higher
on the x-axis.

\end{figure}


Such results support the proposition that some algorithms are inherently
suited either towards human or machine listeners. However, this shows
that such distinction is not necessarily related to the algorithm
class, since the \ac{KLT} and \ac{pKLT} algorithms belonged to the
same \ac{KLT} class, but produced different results.

The \ac{pKLT} and \ac{logMMSE-SPU-4} algorithms were observed to
show reasonable improvement in \ac{PRR} as the \ac{SNR} increased,
but little to no improvement in \ac{PESQ}. This is highlighted in
\figref{direct-pklt-logmmse-spu-4}, and is apparent by the near-zero
gradient. These algorithms likely introduce distortions into the signal
in the process of enhancement that the \ac{ASR} algorithm was immune
to, however would be distracting to a human and therefore performed
badly under the \ac{PESQ} evaluation.

\end{figure}


The final observation drawn from \figref{Direct-PESQ-PRR} is highlighted
in \figref{direct-highcorr}, which shows the \ac{MMSE-SPU}, \ac{STSA-wcosh},
\ac{STSA-weuclid} and \ac{logMMSE-SPU-3} algorithms. These algorithms
show a high, positive correlation with one another, as well as exhibiting
the best results measured for both \ac{PESQ} and \ac{PRR}. The evidence
suggests such a response is the ideal case, and that there exists
algorithms which are capable of performing well for both human and
machine recognisers.

Results found using the grouped comparison method, shown in \figref{Group-PESQ-PRR-LOESS}
indicated that the data could be approximated by a linear model. The
\ac{LOESS} fitted lines were, in most cases, approximately linear.
The results for Wiener algorithms were a notable exception, with a
non-linear variation, even when the outliers are ignored. Overall,
the \ac{LM} fit in \figref{Group-PESQ-PRR-LM} is accepted to be
accurate.

The grouped linear fittings also correlate well with the best performing
individual algorithms, those highlighted in \figref{direct-highcorr}.

{*}{*}\textit{Conclusion, at the moment, is looking to be that in
general there is a good correlation between human and machine listener
improvement, and that, therefore, there will likely be many algorithms
suited to both purposes. However, still to warn that algorithms should
be verified both ways, as one does not imply the other.}


\section{Improving Practicality}


\subsection{Investigating Current Training Requirements}

\ac{PESQ} score results of enhancement by a \ac{BNMF} algorithm
with a varying length of training data supplied are given in \figref{vary-train-moh-pesq}.
These results show an unexpected result. The algorithms perform well \selectlanguage{english}%
