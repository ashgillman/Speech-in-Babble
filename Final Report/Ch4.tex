\section{Humanly Perceived Improvement vs. Machine Performance}


\subsection{Investigating Existing Data}

The direct comparison method outlined in \subsecref{Method-Existing-Data}
was carried out on the data given in \secref{litresults} \textit{\nameref{sec:litresults}}.
The R code used to perform this analysis is given in \lstref{directComp}.

\figref{Direct-PESQ-PRR} shows the results obtained, comparing the
\ac{PESQ} improvement against the \ac{PRR} improvement. \figref{Direct-PESQ-PRR-LOESS}
shows the data fitted with an \ac{LOESS} model and \figref{Direct-PESQ-PRR-LM}
shows the data fitted with an \ac{LM} method.

Results outlined in \tabref{LF-Fit-Direct-Compar-PESQ-PRR} are the
coefficients relating to the \ac{LM} fitted lines in \figref{Group-PESQ-PRR-LM}.

Additionally, a Pearson's correlation table was formed over a number
of the evaluation measures, depicted in \figref{litResCorr}. In this
figure, the statistical evaluation methods are listed in blue, the
\ac{HR} methods are listed in red, and the \ac{MR} methods are listed
in green on the axes. The sparsity in this figure is due to the limited
amount of pre-existing data.

Highlighted in \textcolor{blue}{blue} are the statistical measures,
\textcolor{red}{red} the human perceptual measures and \textcolor{dkgreen}{green}
the machine recognition measures.

\section{Assessing \acl{NMF} Algorithm Training}

The following are the results of investigations attempting to answer
Research Question \ref{enu:ResQ2}, \textit{\RQtwo{}}


\subsection{Investigating Training Requirements}

The results of the experiments proposed in \subsecref{Investigating-Training-Req}
are given in this section. \figref{vary-train-pesq} shows the \ac{PESQ}
results of the \ac{BNMF} algorithm developed by \citet{mohammadiha2013supervised}.
\figref{vary-train-pesq-imp} shows the \ac{PESQ} improvement as
compared to the dirty signal before enhancement. Similarly, \figref{vary-train-segsnr}
shows the segmental \ac{SNR} results of the same algorithm, and \figref{vary-train-segsnr-imp}
shows the segmental \ac{SNR} improvement compared against the signal
before enhancement.

Plots in \Cref{fig:vary-train-pesq,fig:vary-train-pesq-imp,fig:vary-train-segsnr,fig:vary-train-segsnr-imp}
each are arranged with the number of trained utterances on the x-axis
and test score on the y-axis. Furthermore, the plots are arranged
in a grid with rows corresponding to the enhancement algorithm and
columns corresponding to the test. Test labels give information on
the speaker ID and in brackets the sex of both the SoI, and the speakers
used to form the noise babble. Finally, series colour represents the
\ac{SNR} used for the test data, and the line type is dashed when
representing the score of the dirty signal before enhancement. The
R script used to form these plots is given in \lstref{trainReq}.

\figref{train-req-corr} shows a correlogram, an alternate view of
the same data. In the upper panels are scatter plots of each variable
pair. The lower panels are a heatmap of the Pearson's correlation
between the variables. Blue indicates a positive correlation, red
a negative, and the colour intensity indicates the magnitude.

\section{Phoneme-Dependent Variation for the \acl{BNMF} Algorithm}

In order to force phoneme dependence in the algorithms to be modified,
phoneme samples first had to be formed. The phoneme sample recordings
were formed using the script in \lstref{createTestData}, with the
maximum number of samples drawn per phoneme varied. The length of
each sample drawn was $512/FS$, such that 256 frequency bins were
formed after taking the real \ac{FFT}. The typical spectrograms of
the drawn phonemes are given in \figref{drawn-phoneme-spectrogram},
showing the frequency characteristics of each phoneme.

\subsection{Phoneme Dependent Training Data}

The following results relate to the proposed method outlined in \subsecref{Phoneme-Training}.


\subsection{Phoneme Dependent Base Matrix}

The first test conducted was to ensure the modifications to the code
indeed forced the \ac{NMF} spectral component matrix, \lstinline[language=Matlab]!Et!
in the \lstinline[language=bash]!NMF! class, to be the drawn phoneme
bases supplied.
