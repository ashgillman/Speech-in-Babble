Speech enhancement is an important field in modern electronics, finding
many applications from hearing aids, cleaning of audio/visual recordings
and automated speech recognisers in commercial products. These can
range from mobile phones to modern televisions and automobile electronics.
A variety of techniques are available to measure speech enhancement.
These fall into three categories: (1) those for measuring speech enhancement
for a human recogniser; (2) those for measuring speech enhancement
for a machine recogniser; and (3) those measuring speech enhancement
using purely statistical methods. However, when an enhancement algorithm
is proposed it is often only measured by enhancement measures from
one of those categories. Due to there being fundamental differences
from a human listener to a machine listener, it is hypothesised that
the use of a variety of enhancement measures is necessary to properly
measure the performance of an enhancement algorithm. Results indicated
that the hypothesis was true, and that it is possible for a speech
enhancement method that performs well for a machine recogniser to
not perform well for a human recogniser, and vice-versa. Therefore,
it is important to encapsulate a variety of measures in testing, the
recommended tests including PESQ, ASR performance, statistical measures
such as segmental SNR and where possible, MOS.

In addition, a phoneme dependent modification to existing non-negative
matrix factorisation algorithms was proposed and implemented. This
algorithm was found to provide better accuracy for machine recognisers.
Additionally more consistency in results for human recognisers, being
less likely to distort speech.
