\begin_layout Standard
The algorithms outlined throughout the following chapter were implemented
 in MATLAB.
 This environment was selected due to its availability and ease-of-use.
 MATLAB includes a number of tools useful in signal processing and statistical
 analysis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Krauss1994,Jones1997"

\end_inset

, and other authors have provided tools in the MATLAB language 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hoyer2004,Brookes1997,Loizou2008"

\end_inset

, all of which may be implemented within this thesis.
 A limitation of the MATLAB environment in signal processing is the comparative
 performance with lower-level languages, however performance and speed were
 not a primary focus in this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data analysis was conducted using R.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations were run on a MacBook Pro 64-bit system with an Intel Core i7
 2.3GHz 4- core processor with 16GB memory, running OSX 10.9.2, MATLAB R2013a
 and R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10).

Humanly Perceived Improvement vs.
 Machine Performance

The first research area sought to answer research question 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The focus was to compare and contrast the performance differences of speech
 enhancement algorithms when evaluated on a human listener versus a machine
 listener.

Investigating Existing Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data was collected from a number of sources

, most literature takes preference to evaluation measures indicative of
 either human performance or machine performance, but not both.
 Thus, methods had to be developed in order to fairly compare the the results
 between different sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first comparison method was 
\series bold
direct comparison
\series default
.
 This method involved plotting human performance against machine performance,
 and thus was only applicable to a small subset of the results where both
 performances were measured, such as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Paliwal2010"

\end_inset

.
 This data was analysed separately for each type of algorithm investigated.
 Each data set had a 
\begin_inset ERT

 model fitted, in order to quickly and visually judge the accuracy of applying

 An

 linear regression function.
 The main limitation of the direct comparison method was the limited dataset
 available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
grouped comparison

 was also conducted.
 This was performed as above, however similar algorithms were grouped into
 algorithm classes.

A limitation in this analysis is that the test conditions are not fair:
 different noise types, subtle differences in algorithms BLURGH

\begin_layout Subsection
Independent Investigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the lack of existing data on which conclusions can be drawn on the
 human vs.
 machine success of various speech enhancement algorithms, independent test
 were required to be run.
