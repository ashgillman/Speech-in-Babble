\begin_layout Abstract
Speech enhancement is an important field in modern electronics, finding
 many applications from hearing aids to enhancing audio/visual recordings
 and automated speech recognisers in commercial products.
 These can range from mobile phones to modern televisions and automobile
 electronics.
 A variety of techniques are available to measure speech enhancement.
 These fall into three categories: (1) those for measuring speech enhancement
 for a human recogniser; (2) those for measuring speech enhancement for
 a machine recogniser; and (3) those measuring speech enhancement using
 purely statistical methods.
 However, when an enhancement algorithm is proposed it is often measured
 by techniques from only one of those categories.
 Due to there being fundamental differences from a human listener to a machine
 listener, it is hypothesised that the use of a variety of enhancement measures
 is necessary to properly measure the performance of an enhancement algorithm.
 Results indicated that the hypothesis was true, and that it is possible
 for a speech enhancement method that performs well for a machine recogniser
 to not perform well for a human recogniser, and vice-versa.
 Therefore, it is important to encapsulate a variety of measures in testing.
 The recommended tests include PESQ, ASR performance, statistical measures
 such as segmental SNR and where possible, MOS.

\begin_layout Abstract
In addition, a phoneme dependent modification to existing non-negative matrix
 factorisation algorithms was proposed and implemented.
 This algorithm was found to provide better accuracy for machine recognisers.
 The changes did not improve human intelligibility on average, but did perform
 more consistently, being less likely to distort speech.
