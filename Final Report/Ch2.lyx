Babble and other Speech-Related Noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In signal analysis, noise is defined as an unwanted signal.
 In acoustics, a wide range of types of noise may interfere with a signal.
 This noise originates from somewhere within the environment: from a stationary
 source, or a non-stationary source.
 Generally this noise is additive, meaning the mixed signal can be considered
 as the desired signal plus noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis the desired signal, or

 signal, is considered to be a speech signal and the additive noise signal
 (or masker) is considered to be a number of competing speech signals.
 Noise originating from speakers can be classified by the number of speakers

\begin_layout Standard
Human listeners compensate for babble and competing speaker noise by exploiting
 the time-modulated property of the noise.
 Listeners focus on the target speech during moments of low noise levels
 to piece together the target’s message.
 Therefore, human recognition in modulated noise is better than in steady-state
 noise.
 However, the opposite is true for a machine: steady state noise conditions
 are easier to handle than modulated noise with

 Some methods provide better performance than others, but at the expense
 of practicality.
 For example, recognition can be improved under non-stationary noise by
 using a microphone array, however such a set up is more expensive.

It is generally desirable in testing to be able to present noise at different
 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Rather than recording noise in a range of conditions directly, it is more
 convenient to have separate speech and noise and to model the speech with
 noise signal.
 Thus, the effects of babble are often modelled rather than directly recorded.
 This type of babble can be classed as synthetic babble, and may or may
 not accurately represent real babble 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common method of creating synthetic babble is to use a number of
 speech recordings and add them together to form babble.
 This presents a number of issues.
 Firstly, real conversations are not simply a number of voices speaking
 simultaneously.
 Rather, conversations are dynamic, where there is generally one speaker
 but occasionally more or none 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Secondly, synthetic babble generally does not take into effect environmental
 effects, such as reverberation, generally present alongside babble

 The babble model may exploit

, such that a single voice is modelled and extended to multiple speakers
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, whereas other methods leave the model for babble as a generic noise model

 The advantage of the latter is that the same model may be applicable to

\begin_layout Section
Methods for Speech Enhancement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exists a large number of methods for enhancing speech.
 In general, they operate using similar principals: use statistical measures
 to estimate which parts are speech and/or which parts are noise, then either
 extract the speech or remove the noise.
 Spectral subtraction and ideal binary masks each do this in the time-frequency
 domain, whereas subspace methods operate in a lower dimensional subspace.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ideal Binary Mask
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideal binary mask algorithms operate on the time-frequency representation
 of a signal, often called the spectrogram.
 This representation can be formulated by taking the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{STFT}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of the signal, and allows a signal to be represented by time-frequency
 units, i.e.
 frequencies present at a given time.
 The ideal binary mask is a mask, the same size as the input spectrogram,
 with a 1 in time-frequency unit if the desired signal is stronger than
 the noise in that unit, and a 0 otherwise.
 The mask is then multiplied by the spectrogram, leaving only time-frequency
 units where the desired signal is strongest.
 This requires estimation of the signal and noise: which may be done through
 any of the estimators outlined above.
 Alternatively, this may be done using a voice activity detector

 When an element in

 algorithms are based on the initial proposed algorithms by

 These algorithms are based on the alternating variables method (or coordinate

 In these algorithms, first

\end_inset

 is calculated using a least squares method, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $W$

 algorithms can be generally classified by whether a non-negative least
 squares method is used; or a general least squares method where any negative
 values are subsequently set to zero.
 Non-negative least squares methods converge to a local minimum successfully,
 however the calculation cost per iteration is far higher despite attempts
 to improve performance

 General least squares methods may converge to a saddle point as opposed
 to a minima.
 This is generally still preferred under practical conditions due to the
 speed.
 Performance can also be improved by using a good initialisation.

The algorithms presented thus far present a common weakness in that the
 update rules for the component matrix and the activation matrix are the
 same (except that in some cases the component matrix also has a normalisation
 update).
 This means there is little control over which information is captured in
 the component matrix and which is captured in the activation matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following algorithms are variations that attempt to provide further
 control over ensuring that the components are completely captured in the
 component matrix.

This variation on the multiplicative update algorithm can be made where
 it is expected that the components of the signal present themselves individuall
y, i.e.
 the signal is assumed to be a time series of components, but with no simultaneo
us combinations of the components (this could only be true for a single
 speaker).
 Here, the component matrix components are drawn from the desired signal.
 This leaves only the activation matrix to be calculated, so only one update
 rule is required,

This is the case for clean speech signals, where bases are taken to be phonemes
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Taking advantage of this, phonemes may be drawn randomly from speech and
 used to form the spectral component matrix.
 The advantage of this method is that meaning is brought to the components.
 This allows activations of a given component matrix to be compared with
 those of another.

Another method to ensure component information is captured within the component
 matrix is to introduce sparseness constraints on the activation matrix.
 By its nature, the activation matrix should be sparser than the component
 matrix.
 Through the non-negative constraint of

 naturally occurs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The method used depends on the formulation of the problem, but the general

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following three paragraphs outline the three proposed focuses for this
 research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the algorithms are tested for human recognition improvements, but
 rarely for improvements in machine recognition, highlighted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Assessment-methods"

\end_inset

.
 Little literature exists on the comparison of performance between these
 two forms of recognition.
 An area of research proposed is to investigate the relationship between
 human and machine recognition improvement under speech enhancement algorithms,
 to determine if success in one implies the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, much work has been done in literature on speech enhancement
 under noisy conditions.
 Systems are available to improve intelligibility in telecommunication systems,
 or to improve the quality of 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 systems for home technology.
 However, most of the technologies outlined in this literature review have
 not been implemented in end-user systems, such as hearing aids or mobile
 technology.
 This is due to practicality constraints within the algorithms, in particular
 the training requirement, generally required to be specific to the end-user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, improvements have been made in focusing recognition by forcing
 component matrices to represent phonemes.
 However, current algorithms require complicated implementations.
 It is proposed to attempt to simplify the process of introducing phoneme-depend
ence into algorithms.
