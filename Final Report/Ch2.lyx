Babble and other Speech-Related Noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In signal analysis, noise is defined as an unwanted signal.
 In acoustics, a wide range of types of noise may interfere with a signal.
 This noise originates from somewhere within the environment: from a stationary
 source, or a non-stationary source.
 Generally this noise is additive, meaning the mixed signal can be considered
 as the desired signal plus noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis the desired signal, or

 signal, is considered to be a speech signal and the additive noise signal
 (or masker) is considered to be a number of competing speech signals.
 Noise originating from speakers can be classified by the number of speakers
 as

\begin_layout Standard
Human listeners compensate for babble and competing speaker noise by exploiting
 the time-modulated property of the noise.
 Listeners focus on the target speech during moments of low noise levels
 to piece together the target’s message.
 Therefore, human recognition in modulated noise is better than in steady-state
 noise.
 However, the opposite is true for a machine: steady state noise conditions
 are easier to handle than modulated noise with

 of practicality.
 For example, recognition can be improved under non-stationary noise by
 using a microphone array, however such a set up is more expensive.

Modelling Babble

\begin_layout Standard
In a multi-speaker environment, and ignoring other forms of noise, a signal
 can be considered a sum of multiple speakers:

\begin{equation}
X_{Babble}=\sum X_{Speakers}\label{eq:babble-sum-speakers}

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The number of speaker signals used may vary, but to align with with the
 definition for babble should be between three and six.

\begin_layout Standard
It is generally desirable in testing to be able to present noise at different
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

acp{SNR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Rather than recording noise in a range of conditions directly, it is more
 convenient to have separate speech and noise and to model the speech with
 noise signal.
 Thus, the effects of babble are often modelled rather than directly recorded.
 This type of babble can be classed as synthetic babble, and may or may
 not accurately represent real babble 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Krishnamurthy2009"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common method of creating synthetic babble is to use a number of
 speech recordings, adding them together to form babble.
 This presents a number of issues.
 Firstly, real conversations are not simply a number of voices speaking
 simultaneously.
 Rather, conversations are dynamic, where there is generally one speaker
 but occasionally more or none 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

.
 Secondly, synthetic babble generally does not take into effect environmental
 effects, such as reverberation, generally present alongside babble

\begin_layout Subsection
For Analysis and Enhancement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For analysis, it is generally preferable to model a signal as a sum consisting
 of a desired component and a noise component.
 The babble model may exploit 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

, such that a single voice is modelled and extended to multiple speakers
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, whereas other methods leave the model for babble as a generic noise model
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The advantage of the latter is that the same model may be applicable to
 other forms of noise.

Subspace Methods by Decomposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subspace methods focus on reducing the dimensionality of a system.
 This is done by decomposition or factorisation of a signal into lower dimension
al systems.
 Many techniques exist for decomposing a signal, some of which are outlined

These techniques factorise a matrix into two matrix factors of the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{i\times j}\approx B_{i\times k}A_{k\times j}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll j$
\end_inset

, meaning the factorised form may be considered a more compact form.

 The distinguishing characteristic of

 The objective function is designed with an intent that optimisation will
