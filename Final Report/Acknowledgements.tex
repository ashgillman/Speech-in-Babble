Much gratitude goes to my thesis supervisor, Dr. Owen Kenny. Owen
has been beyond helpful all year, and impromptu meetings often took
upwards of an hour. Thank you for the much-needed enlightening conversation
needed to wrap my head around some previously foreign concepts.

A big thank you also goes to my family, Mum, Dad, Alex, not Rhys,
Grandma and Grandad, not only for supporting me through the year,
but also being subject to what was frankly half an hour of life that
can never be earned back in participating in my tests.

Thanks goes to my second family, Narelle and Peter, for providing
meals to keep my sustenance up.

And finally, thank you to Sam, for everything: from providing harsh,
but much needed pep-talks, to proof reading over and over. This thesis
wouldn't have been the HD it surely deserves without you.
