The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cocktail party problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was first posed in 1953 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cherry1953"

\end_inset

, where the human ability, or often difficulty, to hear speech in the presence
 of multiple speakers was noted.
 After analysis into the complexity of the problem, the human ability to
 hear voices presented simultaneously is noted as incredible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cocktail party problem refers to the problem of recognising speech in
 the presence of babble.
 A number of speakers are present, and each can be distinguished individually.
 This has been noted as an extremely difficult task in speech analysis and
 enhancement.
 With the rise of modern technology and the desire to incorporate alternative
 human-machine interfaces, the motivation to improve 
\begin_inset ERT

ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 systems has increased.
 Additionally, the problem still exists of aiding human understanding in
 such situations, e.g.
 hearing aids, cochlear implants or telecommunications systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One method of subspace analysis that has shown promising results is that
 of 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ac{NMF}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is a relatively new method of decomposition proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lee1999"

\end_inset

, and is notable for its parts-based decomposition.
 This means it is effective in identifying and separating the parts of a
 system, which has proven useful in speech enhancement.
 The parts of a desired signal can be learned and later extracted from a
 noisy signal.
 Babble filtering systems are required to be trained to recognise the individual
 speaker, which is often a difficult process and a practical limitation
 in these systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of different challenges have been held with the motivation of improving
 the performance of 
\begin_inset ERT

 systems under difficult noise conditions

\end_inset

.
 Entries into such competitions can be broadly categorised into two categories,
 those that perform recognition themselves, and those that clean the signal
 and supply a cleaned signal to a standardised recogniser.
 Algorithms that fall into the latter category have a possible additional
 application: improving intelligibility for human listeners.
 It is these algorithms that are of interest in this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many methods by which the successfulness of an enhancement algorithm
 may be measured.
 However, the true performance of an enhancement algorithm is dependent
 upon the application.
 Already mentioned have been two broad classifications of application, those
 for human listening such as hearing aids and telecommunications systems,
 and those for machines, or 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 systems.
 The means by which hearing is performed is drastically different for humans
 and machines, and thus perceived enhancement may also be.
 However, this is rarely taken into consideration.
 Nor is there a standard by which enhancement should be measured across
 literature, leading to difficulty in comparing different enhancement algorithms.

The aim of this thesis is to address the following research questions:

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope of the first research area was limited to determining the correlation
 between 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{HR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This also involved identifying enhancement algorithms that perform as outliers,
 i.e., performed well in enhancing for one category but not the other.
 Additionally, the scope included providing a recommendation to future designers
 of enhancement algorithms on which measures to use to efficiently classify
 an enhancement algorithm's performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope of the second research area involved testing the performance of
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{NMF}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 algorithms when the amount of training data supplied was varied.
 The performance measures were to meet the recommendations of the findings
 of the first research question.
 Aims were to identify the effects of over-training and under-training occurred,
 and the number of utterances supplied for optimal training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope of the third research area included development, implementation
 and evaluation of phoneme-dependent modifications to existing state-of-the-art
 
\begin_inset ERT

 algorithms.
 The evaluation measures were to meet the recommendations of the findings
 of the first research question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope throughout the entirety of this thesis did not encompass specific
 applications, and thus did not consider special requirements beyond normal
 hearing for hearing aid and cochlear implant listeners, nor was a consumer-leve
l implementation produced.
