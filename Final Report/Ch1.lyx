The

cocktail party problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 was first posed in 1953 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, where the human ability, or often difficulty, to hear speech in the presence
 of multiple speakers was noted.
 After analysis into the complexity of the problem, it is amazing that humans
 have the ability to hear over one-another at all!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cocktail party problem refers to the problem of recognising speech in
 the presence of babble.
 A number of speakers are present, and each can be distinguished individually.
 This has been noted as an extremely difficult task in speech analysis and
 enhancement.
 With the rise of modern technology and the desire to incorporate alternative
 human-machine interfaces, the motivation to improve

\end_inset

 systems has increased.
 Additionally, the problem still exists of aiding human understanding in
 such situations, e.g.
 hearing aid systems or telecommunications systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One method of subspace analysis that has shown promising results is that
 of

\end_inset

.
 This is a relatively new method of decomposition proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Lee1999"

\end_inset

, with applications to spectral analysis due to the non-negativity constraints
 of

 and the non-negative nature of spectral magnitude data.
 The components of a desired signal and be learned and extracted from a
 signal.
 Babble filtering systems are required to be trained to recognise the individual
 speaker, which is often a difficult process and a practical limitation
 in these systems.

A number of different challenges have been held with the motivation of improving
 the performance of

 systems under difficult noise conditions

.
 Entries into such competitions can be broadly categorised into two categories,
 those that perform recognition themselves, and those that clean the signal
 and supply a cleaned signal to a standardised recogniser.
 Algorithms that fall into the latter category have a possible additional
 application: improving intelligibility for human listeners.
 It is these algorithms that are of interest in this thesis.

Research Questions

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this thesis is to address the following research questions:

\end_inset

Are good enhancement algorithms effective for both human listeners and machine
 listeners? Can a generic and practical speech enhancement algorithm find
 application in signal enhancement and

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Can the results be improved by modifying algorithms to concentrate the focus
 on recognition of the desired speakers voice?
\end_layout

Can the practicality of existing algorithms be improved to allow applications
 in end- user hardware?

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope of this thesis is to develop a general and practical speech enhancemen
t algorithm with applications in a number of areas, including enhancement
 for human listeners and for 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 systems.
 Such an algorithm should be efficient, have low requirements, and operate
 on monaural recordings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope does not encompass specific applications, and thus does not consider
 special requirements beyond normal hearing for hearing aid and cochlear
 implant listeners.
 It is assumed that the performance increases for normal hearing listeners
 will be applicable to impaired hearing listeners.
 Further studies would be required to ensure this is the case.
