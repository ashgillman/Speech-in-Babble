Humanly Perceived Improvement vs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In analysing the results gathered from literature, a fair correlation was
 found between 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PESQ}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PRR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This indicated a correlation between 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MOS}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PRR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Therefore it was concluded that in general and according to these results,
 algorithms that are successful in 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{HR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 applications are likely to be successful in 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 applications, and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Independent investigations supported the findings by directly comparing
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MOS}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 results with 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PRR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 results.
 A correlation was found when the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PRR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 measure was an 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 system's correctness.
 However, a negative correlation was found when false insertions were accounted
 for under the 
\begin_inset ERT

ac{PRR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the ideal binary mask algorithm considered exhibited a direct
 contrast with the general trend.
 The algorithm gave significant improvements in reducing the noise, and
 therefore gave improvements in the accuracy 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PRR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, indicating improvement for 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 However, the algorithm distorted the signal significantly, causing deterioratio
n in quality of 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{HR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the correlation depended on the requirements of the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 system, which are difficult to predict at the phoneme level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus it was determined that an algorithm's performance in enhancement cannot
 be generalised over 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{HR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Although a ``good'' enhancement algorithm is likely successful in both
 applications, this is not guaranteed and therefore must be verified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Recommendations from Investigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended that when enhancement algorithms are analysed, as many
 evaluation measures be used as possible.
 Many of the evaluation measures are relatively simple to use once implemented,
 and so the cost associated with increasing the range of enhancement measures
 is not large in the long term.
 An exception is the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MOS}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 test, which requires a considerable level of human time.
 The 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PESQ}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 score may be used as a replacement, but the correlation between 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PESQ}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{MOS}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in not certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In future work, it is recommended that the correlation between 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{PESQ}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 be investigated under the context of speech enhancement as opposed to measuring
 the quality of a telecommunications medium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Opportunity for Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of opportunities for further work to extend on within
 this research area.
 In this thesis, machine recognition was considered purely through one 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 system, utilising mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and only considering
 the phoneme-level recognition.
 Studies should be further conducted using alternative methods of feature
 extraction for the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word recognition rate, and other higher level recognition measures should
 be investigated.
 This thesis did not take into consideration methods 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{ASR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 systems can use to extract meaning that are robust to errors in the phoneme-lev
el recognition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, with a larger test population and therefore more reliable
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ac{MOS}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 results better conclusions could be drawn on both the relationship between
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ac{HR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and on the relationship between 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

, both under the context of speech enhancement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, such tests should also be conducted using a more diverse range
 of noise types and algorithms in order to be able to generalise the conclusions.

 Algorithm Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of utterances supplied as training was found to have no correlation
 with performance for the algorithms 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ac{BNMF}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 algorithms presented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "mohammadiha2013supervised"

\end_inset

.
 It was however seen that 10 to 20 utterances should be used in order to
 ensure adequate training for consistence in results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, it was shown that in cases, under-training improved results,
 indicating that a higher performance was achievable and showing that the
 current training techniques were suboptimal.
 Thus, promise was shown for the phoneme-dependent variations proposed to
 these algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Phoneme-Dependent Variation Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method for randomly drawing phoneme samples and forming training data
 was successfully implemented.
 The only noted issue in implementation was the possibility of missing some
 short phonemes, such as the voiceless stop phonemes.
 This had been accounted for however, by increasing the number of samples
 drawn per phoneme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using phoneme-dependent modifications, both training and base modifications,
 was not found to provide significant improvement for human listeners against
 the recorded NOIZEUS noise types tested: babble, car and street.
 However, slight improvements were noted against the synthetic babble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus these phoneme-dependent algorithms are more effective in competing
 speaker applications for a human listener.
 It was proposed such phoneme-dependent algorithms may be advantageous in
 source-separation, where a specific voice is required to be extracted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using phoneme-dependent training was found to improve the accuracy of the
 mel-frequency cepstral coefficient automated speech recognition, by reducing
 the number of phoneme insertions.
 This was especially true for the NOIZEUS car noise recordings, but improvements
 were shown in most noise types except competing speaker for machines.
 Phoneme-dependent training has, therefore, been shown to be more discriminative
 in removing noise for machine listeners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Potential application for the phoneme-dependent training algorithm lays
 in in-car electronics.
 The algorithms have been shown to improve for car recorded noise, including
 muffled competing speaker voice which may potentially come from within
 the car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For such phoneme-dependent algorithms, it was found, in general, to be advantage
ous to increase the number of samples per phoneme used.
 No upper bound on this trend was found, although it was suspected that
 one would exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Opportunity for Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opportunity exists to conduct further research into using phoneme-dependence
 for human listeners.
 It has been shown that training using utterances is suboptimal, and additionall
y that phonemic training can improve the performance for machine recognisers.
 A great number of variations within the training stage of 
\begin_inset ERT

ac{NMF}

\end_inset

 algorithms have been proposed, that should be investigated with phoneme-depende
nt modifications.
