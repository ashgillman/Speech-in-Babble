		\begin{itemize}

			%\begin{itemize}
			%	\item Are human and machine listeners fundamentally different?
			%	\item Does an algorithm that provides enhancement for a human listener provide enhancement for a machine listener, and vice-versa?

	\note{My research aims were twofold. The first area sought to answer the question, if I have an algorithm that enhances speech for a human, will it be just as good for a machine? And vice versa.\par ---The second research aim was to then develop some modifications to existing algorithms, and to evaluate their performance using the methods found to be required in the first part.}

\section{Human vs. Machine Evaluation}

\subsection{Intro}
{\nologo
\begin{frame}{Human vs. Machine Hearing}
	\begin{block}{How does a machine ``hear''?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Machine breaks the waveform into a relatively low number of features.
			\item Pattern recognition algorithms categorise based on these features.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{How does a human ``hear''?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Humans hear from about 20Hz to 20kHz
			\item Humans listen to a lot more information, using the entire waveform
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\note{The reason we should consider human and machine enhancement separately is that the way humans and machines listen is fundamentally different. Machines break segments of a waveform down into a small number of features. It then uses these features to identify what is being spoken.\par However, a human listener listens to the entire waveform, over about 20Hz to 20kHz, which is a lot more information.\par So humans should be more sensitive to distortions in the signal.\par On the other hand, humans have an amazing brain to do some complex filtering, thereby enhancing speech on-the-fly.}

I will run through what MOS and PESQ mean shortly.\par What this means is that when I look through literature to decide which enhancement algorithm to use I am not getting the full picture, and can't be certain which algorithm is indeed the most appropriate.}

	\end{block}
	\note{PESQ is an algorithm that attempts to be equivalent to if a MOS test was completed. This is a lot quicker, easier, cheaper and gives an objective score. In general, the correlation with MOS scores has shown to be quite high when analysing telecommunication systems.\par The method I have used to measure machine recognition is the phoneme-level accuracy of an automated speech recognition system. I use the phoneme recognition as the phoneme is the building block of speech.}

These particular algorithms completely distorted recordings according to human listeners, however performed very well in the machine's accuracy improvement.}

\subsection{Findings}
\begin{frame}{Research Question 1 Findings}
	Contrasting Human and Machine Enhancement
	\begin{block}{Findings}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Very little correlation between human perception and accuracy of machine recogniser.
			\item The ideal binary mask improves accuracy of machine recogniser, however completely distorts the signal for a human listener.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\note{So, in terms of contrasting enhancement for humans and machines, it looks like the correlation between improvement for humans and machines is quite insignificant.\par A specific example has been seen where a large improvement for machines is seen, however the same enhancement renders the signal unrecognisable to a human.}

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Research Question 1}
\begin{frame}{Research Question 1 Conclusions}
	\begin{block}{Recommended Measures}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item PESQ
			\item MOS, using a small population
			\item Word recognition rate of machine
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\note{Therefore, it is recommended that in future, authors proposing novel enhancement algorithms should use both human measures, in the form of PESQ, and where possible, MOS also. Even if this is only conducted on a small test sample. And the algorithm should also be tested for improvement for machine recognisers.}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{What does this mean?}
	\fontsize{5cm}{1em}\rmfamily\centering ``Context''
	\note{It is important to note the importance of context and considering the application.\par Had I have implemented my algorithm and only tested the enhancement for human listeners I may never have seen the potential of these phoneme-dependent algorithms.\par Conversely, had I have tested them only against machines, others may have used my algorithms and wasted a lot of time trying to use them for human speech enhancement.}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Research Question 2}
\begin{frame}{Research Question 2 Conclusions}
	Phoneme-Dependence for NMF Algorithms
	\begin{block}{Conclusions}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Phoneme training generally improves algorithm for machine recognisers
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Although not where noise is very similar to voice, such as same sex competing speaker
			\end{itemize}
			\item No significant improvements for human listeners
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\note{So we can conclude that using phoneme training in general gives better enhancement for machines. The exception was where our noise is extremely similar to the voice, in which case we have a poorer performance.\par We also saw that using the phoneme dictionary improved some of the previously bad performing results. This could be exploited by a smart algorithm that knows which enhancement algorithm to use depending on the context.\par We noted no significant improvements for humans.}
\end{frame}
{\nologo\usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{fig/driving.jpg}}%
\begin{frame}{What does this mean?}
	\note{The phoneme dependent algorithms I have created performed very well against noise recordings from within a car. So such algorithms could easily find application for in-car electronics such as car radios, GPS systems and hands-free systems.}

%\begin{frame}{Further Studies}{Where to from here?}
%	\begin{block}{}
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Investigate machine word recognition rate
%			\item Noise context dependent enhancement
%		\end{itemize}
%	\end{block}
%	\note{In terms of future work, there are a number of investigations that could stem from this work.\par Similar studies to mine could be conducted using the machine word recognition rate, which would give further insight into the machine's ability to recognise meaning.\par And investigations could be done into using different enhancement algorithms depending on the type of noise present to get the most efficient enhancement, rather than a one size fits all approach.}
